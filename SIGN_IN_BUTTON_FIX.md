# ✅ Sign In Feature - Implementation Complete

## What Was Fixed

The "Sign In" button is now visible in the header of your PawPal home page!

### Issue Identified
The initial implementation was added to `home-new.blade.php`, but the actual home page uses `home.blade.php` which includes a separate header component at `resources/views/components/header.blade.php`.

### Solution Applied
1. Added "Sign In" button to `components/header.blade.php` (both desktop and mobile navigation)
2. Added the role selection modal HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to `home.blade.php`
3. Cleared Laravel view cache to ensure changes take effect

## 🎯 How to Test Now

### Step 1: Visit the Home Page
Open http://localhost:8000/ in your browser

### Step 2: Look for the Sign In Button
You should now see a **purple "Sign In" button** in the header navigation, next to:
- Home
- Find Pets
- Learn More
- Contact Us

### Step 3: Click Sign In
When you click it, a beautiful modal will appear with two role options:
- 🔧 **System Admin** - Full system access
- 🏠 **Shelter Admin** - Shelter management

### Step 4: Select a Role
Click on either card. The selected card will:
- Change to a blue border
- Get a light blue background
- Enable the "Continue" button

### Step 5: Continue to Login
Click "Continue" and you'll be redirected to the login page with your selected role

### Step 6: Login
Use one of the test accounts:

**System Admin:**
- Email: `admin@pawpal.com`
- Password: `password`

**Shelter Admin:**
- Email: `shelter@pawpal.com`
- Password: `password`
