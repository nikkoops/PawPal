# Testing the Applications Page

## Quick Start

### 1. Access the Page
Navigate to: **http://localhost:8000/admin/shelter/applications**

### 2. Current State
- The page is fully functional and ready to display data
- Currently shows "No Applications Found" because no one has submitted an adoption form yet
- All backend logic, filters, and actions are working

### 3. How to Test with Real Data

#### Option A: Submit an Adoption Application
1. Go to the public adoption page: `http://localhost:8000/adopt`
2. Fill out the adoption form completely
3. Submit the form
4. Return to `http://localhost:8000/admin/shelter/applications`
5. Your application should appear immediately!

#### Option B: Create Test Data via Database
Run this command to create a test application:

```bash
docker exec pawpal_app php artisan tinker
```

Then in Tinker:
```php
$pet = App\Models\Pet::first();
App\Models\AdoptionApplication::create([
    'pet_id' => $pet->id,
    'answers' => [
        'firstName' => 'John',
        'lastName' => 'Doe',
        'email' => 'john@example.com',
        'phone' => '123-456-7890',
        'address' => '123 Main St',
        'occupation' => 'Software Developer'
    ],
    'status' => 'pending'
]);
```

### 4. Test the Features

#### Filter by Status
1. Click the "Status" dropdown
2. Select "Pending" - table updates to show only pending applications
3. Select "Approved" - shows approved applications
4. Select "All Status" - shows everything

#### Filter by Pet Type
1. Click "Pet Type" dropdown
2. Select "Dogs" - shows only applications for dogs
3. Select "Cats" - shows only applications for cats

#### Filter by Date Range
1. Click "Date Range" dropdown
2. Select "Today" - shows applications from today
3. Select "This Week" - shows this week's applications
4. Select "This Month" - shows current month

#### Test Actions
1. **Approve**: Click green checkmark button → Status changes to "Approved" (green badge)
2. **Reject**: Click red X button → Status changes to "Rejected" (red badge)
3. **View**: Click eye icon → Opens detailed modal (if modal is implemented)

#### Test Bulk Actions
1. Check multiple application checkboxes
2. Click "Bulk Actions" dropdown
3. Select "Approve Selected"
4. Confirm the action
5. All selected applications update to "Approved"

### 5. Verify Statistics Update
- Watch the stat cards at the top
- When you change filters or update statuses, the numbers update automatically:
  - **Total Applications**: Shows count of all apps
  - **Pending Review**: Count of pending status
  - **Approved**: Count of approved status
  - **This Month**: Count from current month

### 6. Real-Time Updates Test
1. Open applications page in one browser tab
2. In another tab, submit a new adoption application
3. Refresh the applications page
4. New application appears at the top of the list!

## Expected Behavior

✅ **When Empty**: Shows "No Applications Found" message
✅ **When Filtered**: Only matching applications display
✅ **Statistics**: Always show accurate counts
✅ **Actions**: Update status immediately
✅ **Sorting**: Newest applications appear first
✅ **Pet Images**: Display uploaded pet photos
✅ **Applicant Info**: Show name, email from form
✅ **Responsive**: Works on all screen sizes

## Troubleshooting

### Applications Not Showing
- Check if adoption forms are being submitted successfully
- Verify pet_id exists in applications
- Check database: `docker exec pawpal_app php artisan tinker` then `App\Models\AdoptionApplication::count()`

### Filters Not Working
- Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- Verify route `/admin/shelter/applications/filter` is accessible
- Clear cache: `docker exec pawpal_app php artisan view:clear`

### Images Not Displaying
- Ensure storage symlink exists: `docker exec pawpal_app php artisan storage:link`
- Verify pet images are uploaded correctly
- Check `pets` table has valid image paths
